# DynamicScheduleRenderer

## Project Description
My dynamic schedule renderer captures the current date and time utilising moment.js, and then color codes cells of time corresponding to the average work day. Users can add events which are then stored in localStorage so that they reappear upon re-visiting the application.

## How to use the Project
Enter your event into the text fields in the rows containing time slots. Then press the save button to save your events. Cells colored red indicate that the event is in the past, which cells colored in green indicate that the event is in the future.
